    <h3>This homemade restaurant-style Salsa is the best party food around and a must have snack!</h3>

    <p>Fact: the best salsa is made with fresh tomatoes. 
        It’s not too oniony or garlicy, nor too spicy for my kids, it doesn’t tasting like it came from a can 
        and it has the perfect brightness with the fresh lime. 
        Then it has a classic Mexican flavor with the cilantro and hint of chili powder and cumin.</p>

        <p>The sugar I’d say is only needed if you are using store-bought tomatoes. 
            If you grow your own or buy them at the farmers market, 
            the quality is a bit better and they’re a bit sweeter so the sugar isn’t needed.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>5-6 Roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 can (14 oz) diced tomato</li>
            <li>2 green onions</li>
            <li>1/3cup chopped red onion</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper; chopped de seeded</li>
            <li>handful fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 large clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>1/2 chili powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp granulated sugar (optional)</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a food processor and pulse in 1 second bursts until all ingredients are finely chopped.</li>
            <li>Serve with tortilla chips. Note that salsa always tastes best after it's been refrigerated for a few hours, so if time allows let the flavors marinate together before serving.</li>
            <li>Store in refrigerator up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>
