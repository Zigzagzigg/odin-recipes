    <h3>This homemade restaurant-style Salsa is the best party food around and a must have snack!</h3>

    <p>Fact: the best salsa is made with fresh tomatoes. 
        It’s not too oniony or garlicy, nor too spicy for my kids, it doesn’t tasting like it came from a can 
        and it has the perfect brightness with the fresh lime. 
        Then it has a classic Mexican flavor with the cilantro and hint of chili powder and cumin.</p>

        <p>The sugar I’d say is only needed if you are using store-bought tomatoes. 
            If you grow your own or buy them at the farmers market, 
            the quality is a bit better and they’re a bit sweeter so the sugar isn’t needed.</p>
